name: Unauthorized Operator Sending Dangerous Commands
description: |
  An operator with insufficient privileges attempts to send dangerous commands
  (e.g., deorbit, disable power) that could compromise mission safety.
  
  This scenario demonstrates Zero-Trust policy enforcement and role-based
  access control in the TT&C gateway.

objectives:
  - Execute destructive commands without proper authorization
  - Bypass safety controls
  - Cause mission disruption

assumed_attacker:
  type: Insider Threat / Compromised Account
  capabilities:
    - Valid operator credentials (but insufficient privileges)
    - Access to ground station systems

tactics:
  - SPARTA: T0005 - Unauthorized Command Execution
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1078 - Valid Accounts

techniques:
  - Use operator/engineer role to attempt admin-only commands
  - Attempt commands during critical mission phases
  - Rapid command execution to overwhelm controls

expected_observables:
  - TT&C Gateway: Policy decision logs showing "denied"
  - TT&C Gateway: Anomaly detection alerts (rate limit, unusual role activity)
  - Space-SOC: Policy violation events
  - Space-SOC: Anomaly events with high severity

playbook_steps:
  1. Operator authenticates with non-admin token
  2. Attempts to send "deorbit" command
  3. TT&C gateway policy engine evaluates request
  4. Policy denies command (insufficient role)
  5. Anomaly detector flags unusual activity
  6. Events are logged and sent to Space-SOC
  7. Incident is created for security review

mitigations:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Policy-as-code enforcement
  - Command risk classification
  - Anomaly detection on command patterns
  - Full audit logging

severity: high
