name: Command Execution During Critical Mission Phase
description: |
  An operator attempts to execute non-critical commands during a critical
  mission phase, potentially disrupting important operations.
  
  This scenario demonstrates mission phase-aware policy enforcement.

objectives:
  - Execute commands during restricted mission phases
  - Disrupt critical operations
  - Bypass phase-based restrictions

assumed_attacker:
  type: Insider Threat / Misconfiguration
  capabilities:
    - Valid operator credentials
    - Access to command interface

tactics:
  - SPARTA: T0008 - Mission Phase Violation
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1498 - Network Denial of Service

techniques:
  - Send non-critical commands during critical phase
  - Attempt to override phase restrictions
  - Ignore mission phase warnings

expected_observables:
  - TT&C Gateway: Policy decision showing phase restriction
  - TT&C Gateway: Mission phase context in logs
  - Space-SOC: Policy violation events
  - Space-SOC: Phase-aware incident creation

playbook_steps:
  1. Mission enters critical phase
  2. Operator attempts non-critical command
  3. Policy engine checks mission phase
  4. Policy denies command (phase restriction)
  5. Event logged with phase context
  6. Space-SOC creates phase-aware incident
  7. Mission control reviews violation

mitigations:
  - Mission phase tracking
  - Phase-aware policy rules
  - Command classification by criticality
  - Operator training on phase restrictions
  - Automated phase transition notifications

severity: medium
