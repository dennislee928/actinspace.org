name: Ground IT Compromise Pivoting to TT&C
description: |
  An attacker compromises the ground IT infrastructure and attempts to
  pivot into satellite operations by accessing TT&C systems.
  
  This scenario demonstrates multi-segment attack detection and correlation
  across different system planes.

objectives:
  - Gain access to ground IT systems
  - Pivot to mission-critical TT&C infrastructure
  - Exfiltrate sensitive mission data
  - Disrupt satellite operations

assumed_attacker:
  type: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
  capabilities:
    - Initial access to ground IT
    - Lateral movement capabilities
    - Credential theft

tactics:
  - SPARTA: T0001 - Initial Access (Ground Segment)
  - SPARTA: T0002 - Lateral Movement
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1021 - Remote Services
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1078 - Valid Accounts

techniques:
  - Compromise ground IT systems
  - Steal operator credentials
  - Access TT&C gateway with stolen credentials
  - Attempt to send commands from compromised account

expected_observables:
  - CI/CD: Unusual build activities
  - Ground IT: Unusual login patterns
  - TT&C Gateway: Commands from unusual source IPs
  - TT&C Gateway: Time-of-day anomalies
  - Space-SOC: Correlated events across multiple components
  - Space-SOC: Multi-stage incident timeline

playbook_steps:
  1. Attacker compromises ground IT system
  2. Steals operator credentials
  3. Accesses TT&C gateway from unusual location/time
  4. Anomaly detector flags unusual role activity
  5. Policy engine may allow commands (valid credentials)
  6. Space-SOC correlates events from multiple sources
  7. Security team identifies multi-stage attack
  8. Incident response initiated

mitigations:
  - Network segmentation
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Behavioral anomaly detection
  - Centralized security monitoring
  - Incident correlation and analysis
  - Regular credential rotation

severity: critical
