name: Uplink Spoofing / Command Flood Attack
description: |
  An attacker attempts to send raw commands directly to the TT&C gateway
  or satellite, bypassing the official ground station, or floods the system
  with commands to cause denial of service.
  
  This scenario demonstrates authentication enforcement and rate limiting.

objectives:
  - Bypass authentication controls
  - Flood the system with commands
  - Cause denial of service
  - Inject unauthorized commands

assumed_attacker:
  type: External Attacker
  capabilities:
    - Network access to TT&C gateway
    - Ability to craft HTTP requests
    - Potential RF access (simulated)

tactics:
  - SPARTA: T0006 - Uplink Interference
  - SPARTA: T0007 - Command Injection
  - MITRE ATT&CK: T1499 - Endpoint Denial of Service

techniques:
  - Send unauthenticated requests to gateway
  - Rapid command flooding
  - Spoof source addresses
  - Attempt to bypass authentication middleware

expected_observables:
  - TT&C Gateway: Authentication failures
  - TT&C Gateway: Rate limit exceeded events
  - TT&C Gateway: Command burst anomalies
  - Space-SOC: Multiple anomaly events
  - Space-SOC: High-frequency unauthorized access attempts

playbook_steps:
  1. Attacker sends unauthenticated command to gateway
  2. Gateway rejects request (missing/invalid token)
  3. Attacker attempts rapid command flooding
  4. Anomaly detector flags command burst
  5. Rate limiting blocks excessive requests
  6. All events logged to Space-SOC
  7. Security team investigates attack pattern

mitigations:
  - Strong authentication (token-based, future: mTLS)
  - Rate limiting per source
  - Anomaly detection on traffic patterns
  - Network segmentation
  - DDoS protection

severity: high
